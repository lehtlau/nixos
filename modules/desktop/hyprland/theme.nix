# theme.nix - Official Catppuccin Mocha colors for unsupported applications
#
# This theme file now serves as a fallback for applications that don't have
# direct catppuccin/nix module support (like wofi, thunar, obsidian, etc.)
# Most applications now use the official Catppuccin theming via catppuccin/nix modules.
